# Terminologies

* **AWS Built-in modules**: The GitHub repositories are based on AWS Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA), which provide templates for enabling AWS foundational security services such as CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and Security Hub.
* **AWS Built-in projects**: The GitHub repositories built by partners in partnership with AWS. While building these projects, partners use the provided AWS Built-in modules to enable AWS services as needed before creating partner-specific assets. The solution contains (1) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates to automate enablement of both AWS and partner services, and (2) wrappers for most common formats such as CfCT manifest, AWS Service Catalog baselines, and more, so customers can pick and choose from the available services.
