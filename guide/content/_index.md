# IBM Security QRadar Log Insights ABI Integration

The purpose of this document is to walk you through the process of utilizing the AWS Built In program (ABI) program along with QRadar Log Insights to easily setup and configure both CloudTrail and Guard Duty (optionally) in your AWS multi-account structure using AWS Control Tower or AWS Organizations and easily configure the ingestion of that data into QRadar Log Insights.

The AWS Built-in program is a differentiation program that validates Partner solutions which have automated their solution integrations with relevant AWS foundational services like identity, management, security and operations.  This program helps customers find and deploy a validated Partner solution that addresses specific customer use cases while providing deep visibility and control of AWS native service integration.
